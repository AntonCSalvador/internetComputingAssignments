3 WAYS TO LINK CSS

1. External:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">

<style>...</style>

3. Inline

<tag style="css goes here">

Textbox
<input type="text">

Radio Button
<input type="radio">

Check Box
<input type="check">

Attributes To IDENTIFY:
name
id
     usually these two are the same

WE READ BETTER ON SCREENS WITH A SANS SERIFF FONT
     Tahoma, etc.

On paper, its better with serif font

In HEXCOLOR:
#FF0000
First 2 are Red, NExt 2 are Green, 3rd 2 are Blue

A7 in base10 is 167

rgb(255, 255, 255)

#0000FF is blue

#FFFFFF is white

#000000 is black
     absence of all color is black
     
#AAAAAA is grey

rgb(255,255,255,0.1)
     the 0.1 is transparency

on input types you can add onClick="functionName()" and put that in the javascript to do stuff like alert or getElementById and so on
     EX:
          <input type="button" value="Process" onClick="processData()">

span is just div but auto inline i think
