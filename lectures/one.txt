LAMP STACK
Linux
Apache
MySQL
PHP

Linux commands poggers bruh:
command   -options   args
ls -l [fileName]
know
grep (global regular expression point)
chmod
cp


4 - r
2 - w
1 - x (execute)
660
read write read write NONE

EX: chmod 600 index.html would change the permissions and people cant see it now

604 is probably ideal with chmod 604 index.html

EVERYTHING IN PUBLIC-HTML IS WHATS SHOWN I THINK like cise.ufl.edu/~aritzhaupt/assign1/
